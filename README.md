These are files specific to Windows 10. These should be stored where the global installation is located. On a default MS-Windows 32-bit GUI Vim installation, that is most likely `C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim\`.

* **/vim82** - Contains the "codeschool" colorscheme and SCSS indentation rules. This should be copied onto the existing `vim82` directory
* **_gvimrc** - Windows GUI configuration file
* **_vimrc** - Windows configuration file
